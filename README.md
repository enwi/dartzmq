# dartzmq
A simple dart zeromq implementation/wrapper around the libzmq C++ library


## Features
Currently supported:
- Creating sockets (`pair`,  `pub`,  `sub`,  `req`,  `rep`,  `dealer`,  `router`,  `pull`,  `push`,  `xPub`,  `xSub`,  `stream`)
- Sending messages (of type `List<int>`)
- Bind (`bind(String address)`)
- Connect (`connect(String address)`)
- Curve (`setCurvePublicKey(String key)`, `setCurveSecretKey(String key)` and `setCurveServerKey(String key)`)
- Socket options (`setOption(int option, String value)`)
- Receiving multipart messages (`ZMessage`)
- Topic subscription for `sub` sockets (`subscribe(String topic)` & `unsubscribe(String topic)`)
- Monitoring socket states (`ZMonitor` & `MonitoredZSocket`)


## Getting started
Currently Windows and Android are officially supported as platforms.
Basically there a no extra setup steps unless the provided zeromq binary does not work for your platform.
I have tested this on Windows and Android, which both work. 
Other platforms have not been tested, but should work. 
If you have tested this plugin on another platform and got it to work, please share your steps and create an issue so I can add it to the list below.

## Usage
Create context
```dart
final ZContext context = ZContext();
```

Create socket
```dart
final ZSocket socket = context.createSocket(SocketType.req);
```

Connect socket
```dart
socket.connect("tcp://localhost:5566");
```

Send message
```dart
socket.send([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

Receive `ZMessage`s
```dart
socket.messages.listen((message) {
    // Do something with message
});
```

Receive `ZFrame`s
```dart
socket.frames.listen((frame) {
    // Do something with frame
});
```

Receive payloads (`Uint8List`)
```dart
socket.payloads.listen((payload) {
    // Do something with payload
});
```

Receie socket events
```dart
final MonitoredZSocket socket = context.createMonitoredSocket(SocketType.req);
socket.events.listen((event) {
    log('Received event ${event.event} with value ${event.value}');
});
```
```dart
final ZSocket socket = context.createSocket(SocketType.req);
final ZMonitor monitor = ZMonitor(
    context: context,
    socket: socket,
    event: ZMQ_EVENT_CONNECTED | ZMQ_EVENT_CLOSED, // Only listen for connected and closed events
);
monitor.events.listen((event) {
    log('Received event ${event.event} with value ${event.value}');
});
```

Destroy socket
```dart
socket.close();
```

Destroy monitor
```dart
monitor.close();
```

Destroy context
```dart
context.stop();
```

### Using a custom `libzmq` binary

#### Windows
Place a shared library of `libzmq` next to your executable (for example place `libzmq-v142-mt-4_3_5.dll` in the folder `yourproject/build/windows/runner/Debug/`)

> You can use a shared library of `libzmq` or compile it yourself. 
> Especially when using this on windows you need to make sure that `libzmq` is compiled using `MSVC-2019` if you are using `clang` it will not work ([more info](https://flutterforum.co/t/windows-desktop-flutter-ffi-and-loading-the-clang-library/3842))

#### Android
> Note that you need to use Android NDK version r21d. Newer versions are currently not supported (see https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4276)

1. Follow [these steps](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/tree/master/builds/android) to build a `libzmq.so` for different platforms
   - If you need `curve` support make sure to set the environment variable `CURVE` either to `export CURVE=libsodium` or `export CURVE=tweetnacl` before running the build command
2. Include these in your project following [these steps](https://github.com/truongsinh/flutter-ffi-samples/blob/master/packages/sqlite/docs/android.md#update-gradle-script)
3. Include the compiled standard c++ library `libc++_shared.so` files located inside the Android NDK as in step 2 ([reference](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support#cs))
   - You can find these inside the Android NDK for example under this path `ndk\21.4.7075529\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\sysroot\usr\lib`
